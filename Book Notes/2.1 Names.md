## Naming Rules

- Must begin with letter or underscore
- Can have anything else after (letters, numbers, underscores)

## Visibility Rules

**Case of first letter determines visibility across packages:**

Capital letter (e.g., `Printf`) → **Exported**

- Can be used outside its own package
- Example: `Printf` in [[fmt Package]]

Lowercase letter → **Unexported**

- Private to package
- Cannot be accessed outside package

## Style Convention

Go programmers use **camelCase**
