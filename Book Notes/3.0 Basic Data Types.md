There are four different `types` in Go:

1. Basic Types
2. Aggregate Types
3. Reference Types
4. Interface Types

The entirety of Chapter 3 is going to be about Basic Types which are:

- Numbers
- Strings
- Booleans

Aggregate Types are in arrays (Section 4.1) and structs (Section 4.4).
Reference Types are about pointers (Section 2.3.2), Slices (Section 4.2), Maps (Section 4.3), Functions (Chapter 5), and Channels (Section 8).
Interface Types are in Chapter 7.
