## Key Concepts

- Go is a compiled language: Source Program → Machine Code
- Use `go build [filename].go` to compile, then `./[filename]` to run
- Creates an executable binary file

## Package Structure

- Go code organized into [[Packages]]
- Each .go file starts with package declaration
- `package main` = standalone executable (not a library)
- `main` function = where execution starts

## Import Rules

- Only import what you need
- Unnecessary imports → won't compile

## Function Declaration

Starts with: `func` + name + parameters + results + body

## Syntax Notes

- No semicolons required at end of statements

## Code Example
