## Topics Briefly Covered

### Switch Statements

See: [[Switch Statements]]

Basic switch:

```go
switch coinflip() {
    case "heads":
        heads++
    case "tails":
        tails++
    default:
        fmt.Println("landed on edge!")
}
```

Tagless switch (switch true):

```go
func Signum(x int) int {
    switch {
    case x > 0:
        return +1
    default:
        return 0
    case x < 0:
        return -1
    }
}
```

### Control Flow

- `break` in switch → go to next statement
- `continue` in for → go to next iteration

### Named Types

Example:

```go
type Point struct {
    X, Y int
}
var p Point
```

### Pointers

See: [[Pointers]]

- Pointers = variables containing address of a variable
- `&var` → address of variable
- `*var` → value that pointer refers to

### Methods and Interfaces

- [[Methods]] = "function associated with a named type"
- [[Interfaces]] = "abstract types that treat different concrete types the same way based on their methods"

### More Packages
