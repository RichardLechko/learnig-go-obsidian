Constants are guaranteed to be evaluated at compile time.

You declare constants with the `const` declaration. 

Constants can not have their values changed, so they're great for mathematical constants like:

```go
const pi = 3.14159
```

You can also group constants:

```go
const (
	e = 2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369995957496696763
	pi = 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459
)
```

And because all constants get evaluated at compile time, that also means the result of all arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations applied to constant operands are themselves constants, meaning they also get evaluated at compile time.

You can also use const with types:

```go
const noDelay time.Duration = 0
const timeout = 5 * time.Minute

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("%T %[1]v\n", noDelay)
	fmt.Printf("%T %[1]v\n", timeout)
	fmt.Printf("%T %[1]v\n", time.Minute)
}
```

This will print:

```txt
time.Duration 0s
time.Duration 5m0s
time.Duration 1m0s
```

You can also declare constants like this:

```go
const (
	a = 1
	b
	c = 2
	d
)
```

And these are the values:

```txt
a = 1    b = 1   c = 2   d = 2
```

### 3.6.1 The Constant Generator `iota`

The constant generator `iota` helps create constants without having to constantly type out the type:

```go
const (
	Sunday Weekday = iota
	Monday
	Tuesday
	Wednesday
	Thursday
	Friday
	Saturday
)
```

This will produce this value:

```txt
0 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

You can also do a more complicated expression:

```go
type Flags uint

const (
	FlagUp Flags = 1 << iota
	FlagBroadcast
	FlagLoopback
	FlagPointToPoint
	FlagMulticast
)
```

This will produce:

```txt
1 2 4 8 16
```

### 3.6.2 Untyped Constants

There are six different types of untyped constants, which are just constants that are not given a type: `untyped boolean`, `untyped integer`, `untyped rune`, `untyped floating-point`, `untyped complex`, and `untyped string`.

Only constants can be untyped. If a untyped constant appears on the right-hand side of a variable declaration with an explicit type, then untyped constant becomes typed:

```go
var f float64 = 3 + 0i // untyped complex -> float64
f = 2                  // untyped integer -> float64
f = 1e123              // untyped floating-point -> float64
f = 'a'                // untyped rune -> float64
```
