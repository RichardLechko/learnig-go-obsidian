This chapter talks about what composite types are and will be focusing on `arrays`, `slices`, `maps`, and `structs`.

`Arrays` and `structs` are aggregated types, they're just a collection of other values in memory. Arrays can only hold values that are all the same type but structs can hold values of multiple types. Arrays and structs are both fixed size. Slices and maps are dynamic data structures that grow with the data.
