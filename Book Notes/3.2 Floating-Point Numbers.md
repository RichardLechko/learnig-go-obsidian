There are two floating point numbers which are `float32` and `float64` which are governed by the IEEE-754 standard implementation.

`float32` is about 6 digits of precision.
`float64` is about 15 digits of precision.

The book then had us make complex surface plot structures using floating points. I really do not care, so I am skipping all of that. Creating geometric shapes in Go is pointless.
